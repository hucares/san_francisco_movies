Project: SF Movies
Track: Full-stack

Abstract
========
The SF Movies visualizer allows a user to search and visualize filming
locations on a map. A critical requirement is that the search should be
autocompleted. A JavaScript client communicates with a Rack backend.

Frontend
========
The front-end is written using juqery-ui, D3.js and backbone.js. It fetches a JSON
with all the relevant location data and visualized it on Google Maps.

I selected frameworks and tools that would allow speedy and concise development.
The center-piece of the frontend was D3.js since it allowed it can create
visualizations very quickly. It is supremely concise and its
data-driven architechture minimizes the problem of state handling. There
was somedifficulty integrating Google Maps projections with D3's
enter and exit abstractions but I managed to create a workaround.

I use jQuery-ui to manage the autocomplete feature. I selected Google maps
on the basis of its good visual design.

I am proficient with JavaScript. I have extensive experience with
backbone.js and some experience with D3.js.

Backend
=======
The backend of the of the application is a simple static Rack site
deployed over Heroku.

I didn't feel that a full fleshed back-end was strictly neccessary since
the data-set was so small. While my specified track is full stack, I thought
that a full back-end would be entirely unneccessary and would not improve the
customer experience.. Preloading all the locations onto the client improves the
responsiveness.

I employed the Google Places API which successfully geocoded 709 out of the 727
uniuqe locations. I stored the lat-lng results with Pickle and generated a static
JSON file with all the scene locations to be loaded on the client.

I have no experience with Rack and I have limited experience with Heroku.
